# envy-php

Simple ENV file parser

### Basic usage

First require `biohzrdmx/envy-php` with Composer.

Now create a `.env` file, for example:

```dosini
APP_NAME=MyApp
APP_URL=https://app.example.com
APP_DEFAULT="${APP_URL}/dashboard"
APP_DEBUG=true
```

Create now an instance of the `Settings` class:

```php
use Envy\Settings;
$settings = new Settings();
$settings->load( dirname(__FILE__) . '/.env' );
```

If the file can not be loaded it will throw a `RuntimeException`.

Then simply call the `load($name)` function to get the value of the specified option:

```php
$app_name = $settings->get('APP_NAME');
```

You may also define a constant with the same name by using the `define($name)` method:

```php
$settings->define('APP_NAME');
echo APP_NAME; # Prints 'MyApp'
```

Finally, you may test options for existence with the `require($name)` function:

```php
# Testing for a single option
$settings->require('APP_NAME');

# Testing for multiple options
$settings->require([ 'APP_NAME', 'APP_URL' ]);
```

If a required setting is not available it will throw a `RuntimeException`.
